      <note>
        <para>
          This is a note. The information in a note is usually in the form

        </para>
      </note>
      <important>
        <para>

          something you must be aware of before moving on.
        </para>
      </important>
      <warning>
        <para>
          This is a warning. The information in warnings is critical.

          security issues.
