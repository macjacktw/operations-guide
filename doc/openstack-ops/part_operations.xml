            <para>Congratulations! By now, you should have a solid design for
                your cloud. We now recommend that you turn to the <link
                    xlink:title="OpenStack Install and Deploy Manual for Ubuntu"
                    xlink:href="http://docs.openstack.org/havana/install-guide/install/apt/"
                    >OpenStack Install and Deploy Manual for Ubuntu</link>
                (http://docs.openstack.org/havana/install-guide/install/apt/),
                which contains a step-by-step guide on how to manually install
                the OpenStack packages and dependencies on your cloud.</para>
            <para>While it is important for an operator to be familiar with
                the steps involved in deploying OpenStack, we also strongly
                encourage you to evaluate configuration-management tools such
                as <glossterm>Puppet</glossterm> or
                <glossterm>Chef</glossterm> that can help automate this
                deployment process.</para>
            <para>In the remainder of this guide, we assume that you have
                successfully deployed an OpenStack cloud and are able to
                perform basic operations such as adding images, booting
                instances, and attaching volumes.</para>
            <para>As your focus turns to stable operations, we recommend that
                you do skim the remainder of this book to get a sense
                of the content. Some of this content is useful to read in
                advance so that you can put best practices into effect to
                simplify your life in the long run. Other content is more
                useful as a reference that you might turn to when an unexpected
                event occurs, such as a power failure, or to troubleshoot a
                particular problem.</para>
